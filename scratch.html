            Hobbies
        </h2>

             One of my favorite activities is skiing! I love the feeling of gliding down a slope, especially when there is fresh, new powder. This is one of the reasons why I absolutely love Utah! Being fortunate enough to grow up next to several different ski resorts, I started skiing from a very young age. It has been a standard family activity for us every winter. Pictured below is a ski resort (althought this one is not in Utah).

             Another one of my favorite hobbies is sports! Since a young age I have enjoyed participating in all kinds of sports. From team sports such as soccer, basketball, and football to extreme sports such as skiing and surfing, I am usually happier if I'm engaged in some form of athletic activity. Recently, I have discovered a love of watching sports. College football and basketball is an activity that my roommates and I love to watch together, as well as most professional leagues. Below is an example of some of my favorite sports players:

            Movies and television are also a large part of my personal life. I have always had a great love for stories, in any type of format. Movies are a fantastic way of storytelling because they are so visual, filmmakers are able to portray cinematic shots that add to the plot of a story. Big blockbuster productions are particularily interesting for me. Below is a Tableau visualization that shows some of the past 2 decades most successful movies.
